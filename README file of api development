## API Development Workspace

This workspace contains one or more API services. Each service has its own README with setup and run instructions.

### Contents

- `orders-api/` – REST API for managing orders (see its `README.md`)

### Quick Start

```powershell
# Pick a service and install deps
cd orders-api
npm install

# Start in development
npm run dev

# or start in production
npm start
```

### Common Environment Variables

Create a `.env` in the service directory:

```env
PORT=4000

# Database
# MongoDB only
# MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/orders

# Auth (if JWT is used)
# JWT_SECRET=changeme
```

### Scripts (typical)

- `npm run dev` – start with live-reload (nodemon)
- `npm start` – start the server with Node
- `npm test` – run tests (if configured)

### Conventions

- Each API keeps code under `src/` with folders like `routes`, `controllers`, `models`, `services`, `middleware`, and `lib`.
- Update the service-level README with exact endpoints and data models.
